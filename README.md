# CS5824_Team6
This is the GitHub repository for the CS5824 19Fall course project (Team6). The project is aimed to 1) reproduce the results in 
the paper titled "Physics-Informed Generative Adversarial Networks by Incorporating Conservation Laws" [1], 2) evaluate the 
findings by running the code and comparing the results we get to the results in Ref [1], 3) get ourselves familiar with the 
principles of how GANs or specifically physics-informed GANs work.
