If_not_removing_the_singularity_point: There is a singularity in the potential flow problem. The author removed many points around the singularity (21.8% of the total pixel points) to avoid issues when training. However, how many points (what percentage) should be removed remains a question (this paper did not discuss this at all). Therefore, we tested on the effect. For this directory, we only removed 9.38% of the total pixel points. For problems having discontinuity (such as flows having shocks) or large gradients (such as boundary layer flows), we cannot neglect the singularity or something like that. 

Note:
1. Every running takes 200 epoches, if not specified
2. The original code did not set the seed number to a specific value (it used the time as the seed number) so we can not reproduce the results there exactly, but just similarly
